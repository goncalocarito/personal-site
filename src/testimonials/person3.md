quote: "I had the privilege to work with Gonçalo for several times. We organized training events and delivered them together in different contexts and organizations. His passion for training and education is truly inspiring. He’s one of the most versatile trainers I’ve met. Despite his passion for data science, he’s able to deliver with excellent quality all types of training. Soft-skills, technical topics such as data science or machine learning, or even how to use poetry to manage your emotions. There is a connection in everything he does, and the content of all kinds of sessions he prepares is very rich and with different insights. He never forgets the human component that makes the difference in any kind of session. As a person, he’s extremely generous and humble. He has an inner desire to constantly self improve, and he values the feedback of everyone. Gonçalo is a passionate trainer and human being who loves to connect and share knowledge above all."
