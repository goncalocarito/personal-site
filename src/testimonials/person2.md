quote: "I attended a 5-day workshop from Gon√ßalo. He puts a lot of effort and creativity into his preparation and makes every session interesting. As a trainer, he is a great facilitator and a patient listener. I liked in his sessions how he visualized evidence-based models and made us understand difficult topics easily. He can easily engage everyone in his sessions. I appreciated a lot the reflection time where he invited us, participants, to share thoughts and step out of our comfort zone."
